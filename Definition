In SQL Server, "Page Reads/sec" is a performance counter that measures the rate at which data pages are read from disk into memory. 
It is a measure of the I/O activity required to satisfy the data access demands of SQL Server.

When SQL Server needs to access data that is not currently in memory (i.e., in the buffer cache), it must read the data from disk into memory. 
The Page Reads/sec counter tracks the number of pages read from disk per second to satisfy these data access requests.

A high Page Reads/sec value indicates that your SQL Server is experiencing a lot of I/O activity and is reading a large amount of data from disk. 
This can be an indicator that your SQL Server is under memory pressure, and is having to read data from disk more frequently because there is not enough memory 
available to store all of the required data pages in the buffer cache.

It is important to note that some level of Page Reads/sec activity is normal and expected in most SQL Server workloads. However, 
if the value is consistently high and the workload is not expected to generate that level of I/O activity, it may indicate that the server is experiencing 
performance issues or that the hardware resources are insufficient to meet the demands of the workload.

What is lazy read in sql server
In SQL Server, lazy read is a performance optimization technique that is used to reduce I/O activity and improve query performance.

Lazy read allows SQL Server to defer the physical read of a data page from disk until it is actually required by a query. When a query needs to access a data page 
that is not currently in memory, SQL Server will schedule a lazy read operation to bring the data page into memory when it is actually required.

This technique is used to reduce the number of unnecessary I/O operations performed by SQL Server. Rather than immediately bringing data pages into memory when they 
are requested, SQL Server will wait until they are actually needed by a query before performing the physical read operation. This can result in significant
performance improvements, especially in situations where data pages are accessed infrequently or sporadically.

It is important to note that lazy read is just one of several techniques used by SQL Server to optimize performance. Other techniques include read-ahead, 
which reads multiple data pages into memory before they are actually requested, and pre-fetching, which anticipates future queries and loads data into 
memory proactively to improve query performance.

W hat is batched request /sec mean
In SQL Server, "Batch Requests/sec" is a performance counter that measures the rate at which batches of SQL statements are executed by the server.

A batch is a collection of one or more SQL statements that are submitted to SQL Server for execution as a single unit of work. Batch Requests/sec counts the number of batches of SQL statements that are executed per second.

This performance counter is a useful metric for measuring the overall workload on a SQL Server instance. A high Batch Requests/sec value indicates that the server is processing a large number of batches of SQL statements, which in turn suggests a high level of user activity or query workload. Conversely, a low Batch Requests/sec value may indicate that the server is experiencing performance issues or that the workload is not as heavy as expected.

It is important to note that Batch Requests/sec is not necessarily a measure of query performance or efficiency, but rather a measure of the server's overall workload. High Batch Requests/sec values do not necessarily indicate good performance, and low values do not necessarily indicate poor performance. It is important to consider other performance metrics, such as CPU utilization, disk I/O, and memory usage, in order to fully understand and optimize the performance of a SQL Server instance.
